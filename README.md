# Pit Stop Prediction in Formula 1 Racing Using Neural Networks
Formula1 Course project done as part of CS539 Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks offered in UW-Madison for Fall 2023

## Objective:
Developed a hybrid Neural Network approach to predict optimal pit-stop decisions in Formula 1 racing.
Utilized a publicly available FastF1 dataset, focusing on a binary classification problem to predict pit-stop occurrence.
## Team:
Badri Narayanan Murali Krishnan, Nixie Koch, and Unmesh Raskar 

## Approach
Applied feature selection techniques, including univariate selection, forward selection, and principal component analysis.
Built two models: Fully Connected Neural Network and a Hybrid Neural Network with LSTM and Fully Connected layers.
Conducted extensive data preprocessing, including filtering for relevant race conditions, one-hot encoding, and standardization.
Results:

## Results
Achieved an accuracy of 98.0% and F1 Score of 92.1% with the Hybrid Neural Network, outperforming the Random Forest baseline.
Demonstrated the importance of dynamic modeling using LSTM for capturing sequential lap information and enhancing pit-stop predictions.
Note: The project showcases a data-driven approach to optimize pit-stop strategies in Formula 1 racing, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
